# Weather-Dashboard-App# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Do you need to check the weather in your city? How about the weather in the city you plan to visit within the week? You can do just that here in this weather application! All you need to do is type in your city of choice, press enter, and there you have it! You'll get the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the UV index of the day, AND the weather forecast for the next five days!

This project was much harder, of course, than the previous ones. I was unable to fully complete it by not getting the local storage to work and not having the search history cities to show below the search bar. With more time, I surely would have completed this, but that is not the case in a Bootcamp course. It's very unfortunate, but I am still proud of what I made because it helped me to learn concepts I couldn't understand before this.

## Credits

Thank you so much to the other students in the Bootcamp with me, who spend hours on hours working together and helping each other when we need it.
